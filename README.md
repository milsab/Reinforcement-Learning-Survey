# Reinforcement-Learning-Survey
Here, I share what I learn in reinforcement learning and its utilization in recommender systems. First, I will list all sources that I found useful and what I learned from them. So, you can find all the stuff that I'm going to write here in the following resources with far better explanations. My purpose is just to summarize what I'm learning in reinforcement learning and its application in recommender systems.
